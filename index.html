			<p>
				I believe that there are 3 important facets to living a happy existence. Tending to your health, maintaining and growing your social life with friends and family, and to constantly work to improve your wealth. 
				<br><br>

				I find these to be the core three rules in my life that keep me going on a day to day basis. Working on health, to me is very literal, eat well, be active, then cut out anything that interferes with those.<br> Growing wealth is easy, learn every day, improve your career by being the best you can, ask questions, anything that will expand your potential for earning the life you crave. In our society this is based of off earning potential, but wealth can mean anything that you own, your ideas and personality would be included in this. <br>The friends and family aspect is the most difficult part of all of this because it is the only one that you can not 100% own, other people have a very large influence on the day to day. You will lose friends and you will lose family but you will always have them in some way shape or form.
